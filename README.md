# WirelessPassfinder
## Overview
WirelessPassfinder is a Python script that helps you discover and retrieve the WiFi passwords stored on your system. It uses the iwgetobj command to fetch the password information and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Features
Retrieves WiFi passwords stored on your system
Displays password information for each profile
I will also write for the Linux side later
## Usage
Clone or download the repository
Run the script using Python: python wireless_passfinder.py
The script will display a list of WiFi profiles and their corresponding passwords
## Note
This script requires the iwgetobj command to be installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using your package manager.
This script only retrieves passwords stored on your system and does not attempt to crack or decrypt passwords.
Please use this script responsibly and only for legitimate purposes.
